	abstract = {We introduce a new paradigm for generative modeling built on Continuous Normalizing Flows ({CNFs}), allowing us to train {CNFs} at unprecedented scale. Specifically, we present the notion of Flow Matching ({FM}), a simulation-free approach for training {CNFs} based on regressing vector fields of fixed conditional probability paths. Flow Matching is compatible with a general family of Gaussian probability paths for transforming between noise and data samples -- which subsumes existing diffusion paths as specific instances. Interestingly, we find that employing {FM} with diffusion paths results in a more robust and stable alternative for training diffusion models. Furthermore, Flow Matching opens the door to training {CNFs} with other, non-diffusion probability paths. An instance of particular interest is using Optimal Transport ({OT}) displacement interpolation to define the conditional probability paths. These paths are more efficient than diffusion paths, provide faster training and sampling, and result in better generalization. Training {CNFs} using Flow Matching on {ImageNet} leads to consistently better performance than alternative diffusion-based methods in terms of both likelihood and sample quality, and allows fast and reliable sample generation using off-the-shelf numerical {ODE} solvers.},
