Welcome to the Renjie Liao's lab for Deep Structure Learning (DSL) at UBC!

Our long-term research goals revolve around:
1. Perception: building machines that can learn structures (abstraction) from data
2. Reasoning: building machines that can perform automated inference
3. Understanding deep learning

In particular, our current research areas involve:
- Deep Generative Models
- Geometric Deep Learning
- Algorithmic Reasoning with Transformers (e.g., LLMs)
- Probabilistic Inference
- Visual Understanding and Reasoning
- Motion Prediction and Planning in Self-driving
- AI for Healthcare
